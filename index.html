          <blockquote cite="https://rxjs.dev/">
            RxJS is a library for

            easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

            <h3>Reactive Programming</h3>
            <blockquote>
              Reactive programming utilizes data streams, which are continuous
              flows of information. You declare your interest in specific parts
              of the stream, and the system automatically reacts and delivers
              the data or performs actions based on changes.

            <h3>Reactive Programming</h3>
            <blockquote>
              Within these streams, you use declarative operators to express how
              you want to manipulate the data. These operators transform the
              data without needing to write detailed loops or conditional
              statements.

            <h3>Reactive Programming</h3>
            <blockquote>
              Declarative programming defines the overall goal, and reactive
              programming provides the mechanism to handle the ever-changing
              data and automatically react to those changes based on your
              declared goals. statements.

            <h4>Observables and Subscriptions - Newspaper Delivery Analogy</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: medium">
              <li>
                Imagine an Observable as a newspaper delivery service. It
                constantly publishes new editions (data emissions).
              </li>
              <li>
                You, the subscriber, are like someone who signs up for a
                subscription. You express interest in receiving the newspaper
                (data).
              </li>
              <li>
                When you subscribe, you're essentially telling the delivery
                service (Observable) to bring you the papers whenever a new
                edition comes out (data is emitted).
              </li>
              <li>
                You can unsubscribe anytime you're no longer interested (you can
                stop receiving deliveries).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Operators - Recipe Book Analogy</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: medium">
              <li>Think of operators as a recipe book for your data stream.</li>
              <li>
                Each operator is like a recipe that takes the incoming data
                (ingredients) and transforms it into something new (the cooked
                dish).
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, a map operator is like adding spices to your data,
                a filter operator is like picking specific ingredients, and a
                concat operator is like combining two recipes (data streams)
                into one meal (final data output).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Subjects - Town Crier Analogy</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: medium">
              <li>
                Imagine a Subject as a town crier who broadcasts important
                announcements (data emissions).
              </li>
              <li>
                Multiple subscribers (townspeople) can listen to the
                announcements (data).
              </li>
              <li>
                Unlike Observables which typically have a single source,
                Subjects allow you to actively emit data yourself, just like the
                town crier initiating the announcements.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Schedulers - Traffic Light Analogy</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: medium">
              <li>
                Schedulers are like traffic lights that control the flow of data
                emissions in your RxJS streams.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can use schedulers to manage the timing of data delivery,
                ensuring a smooth flow and preventing overwhelming situations,
                just like traffic lights control the flow of cars to avoid
                congestion.

            <h4>Cold vs. Hot Observables - Pre-Recorded vs. Live TV Analogy</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: medium">
              <li>
                Cold Observables are like pre-recorded shows. When you
                subscribe, you get a fresh playback from the beginning (data
                emissions start anew).
              </li>
              <li>
                Hot Observables are like live TV. When you subscribe, you join
                an ongoing stream and receive data from that point onwards (you
                might miss some initial emissions).
              </li>

            <h4>Return cold observables from services</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: medium">
              <li>
                <b>Predictable and Repeatable</b>: Cold observables act like a
                fresh start each time you subscribe. This ensures you always get
                the latest data, regardless of previous subscriptions. Imagine a
                cold observable as a brand new roll of film in a camera. Every
                time you take a picture (subscribe), you capture a fresh image
                (data emission) at that specific moment.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Independent Streams</b>: Each subscription to a cold
                observable creates a completely independent data stream. This
                means multiple components can subscribe to the same service
                without interfering with each other. Think of it like multiple
                movie theaters showing the same film reel (observable)
                simultaneously. Each theater has its own projector and audience
                (subscriptions) experiencing the movie independently.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Error Handling</b>: Cold observables allow for better error
                handling because errors are emitted on a per-subscription basis.
                You can handle errors specifically for each component that
                subscribes. Imagine a cold observable as a recipe (data). Each
                time you cook the recipe (subscribe), there's a chance of a new
                ingredient being spoiled (error). You can check for freshness
                (error handling) independently for each time you cook the
                recipe.
              </li>

          <section>
            <h4>Avoid observables inside subscription handlers</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: medium">
              <li>
                Moving values out of RxJS scope into imperative JS scope, only
                to put them back into RxJS scope is usually brittle.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Try to keep operator functions pure</h4>
            <p style="font-size: medium">
              An opeartor function will be pure if it doesn't mutate their
              input, read outside data, mutate outside and/or have other
              side-effects.
              <br /><br />
              This can lead to problems like dropped errors, subscription leaks
              and race conditions.
            </p>
            <pre><code data-line-numbers>currentValue: number;
this.currentValueObs = this.someService.someObservable.pipe(
	tap(value => {
		this.currentValue = value;
	});
);
</code>
		</pre>
            <p style="font-size: medium">
              Instead, we can just use currentValueObs via functions like
              <code>.subscribe()</code> and <code>| async</code>.
